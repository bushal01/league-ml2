--------

The entrypoint for the code in this project is run_process.py.

run_process.py modes:
- crawl
- history
- train
- score

### crawl
To build a dataset of matches, one must query for a summoner's match history.  Using that history, one can then acquire
more summoner IDs, and continue crawling.

##### Parameters
- prime_data_dir  # directory of data that has already been crawled
- summoner_name  # if no prime_data_dir supplied, supply a summoner_name with which to begin the crawl
- crawl_time  # time in hours to crawl

### history
Look up a summoner name or encrypted id, and aggregate their history on all champions played

##### Parameters
- summoner_name  # plaintext of summoner name
- summoner_id  # encrypted summoner id, will be used over summoner name if available
- queue  # what type of queue
- season  # specific season
